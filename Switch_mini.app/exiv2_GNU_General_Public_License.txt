Commercial version

==================

If you have a commercial license, you must disable NLS support and

the conversion of Nikon lens data to readable lens names to build a

commercial version of the Exiv2 library.

To do this on Windows, compile the library with the preprocessor

symbol EXV_COMMERCIAL_VERSION defined in:

   msvc2003\include\exv_msvc.h

or msvc2005\include\exv_msvc.h

On UNIX-like systems, run the configure

script with the options --enable-commercial --disable-nls

--disable-lensdata.

# That's all Folks

src/tiffimage.cpp

To be able to write certain tags I have to override defence mechanism

This part

                                 const PrimaryGroups* pPrimaryGroups) const
     {
         if (!hasImageTags_) {
 #ifdef DEBUG
             std::cerr << "No image tags in this image\n";


is changed to this


IfdId          group,
                                 const PrimaryGroups* pPrimaryGroups) const
     {
         if ( hasImageTags_) return false;
         if (!hasImageTags_) {
 #ifdef DEBUG
             std::cerr << "No image tags in this image\n";
